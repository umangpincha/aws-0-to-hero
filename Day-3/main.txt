EC2 - Elastic Cloud Compute
--------------------------------

TODO: Types of EC2 :

1) General purpose
2) Compute Optimized 
3) Memory Optimized
4) Storage Optimized
5) Accelerated Optimized

TODO: Regions :
There are multiple regions where we can create our ec2 instances 
for ex: if any client wants there datacenter to be nearby there location 
then devops engineer can create instance near to there location  

Do practical on AWS console

TODO: Availibility Zone (AZ):

In regions we have multiple AZ's

Like we have us-east-1 as a region in which we have us-east-1-a , us-east-1-b as AZ's.

Now create ec2 instance on AWS console.
